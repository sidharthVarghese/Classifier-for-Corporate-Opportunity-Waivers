COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a &#8220;pandemic,&#8221; has spread to many countries, including the United States, and is impacting domestic and worldwide economic activity. Since being declared a &#8220;pandemic&#8221;, COVID-19 interfered with our ability to meet with certain customers during 2020 and continued into the first half of 2021. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected the supply chain for many types of products and materials, particularly those being manufactured in China and other countries where the outbreak has resulted in significant disruptions to ongoing business activities.  The corporate opportunity waiver was included in the company's bylaws. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022, we experienced a material disruption in our supply chain as it relates to the procurement of certain sole source and other multiple source components utilized in a material portion of several product lines. There are frequent developments regarding the COVID-19 outbreak that may impact our customers, employees and business partners. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate the duration or the scope of the impact COVID-19 could have on the Company&#8217;s business. The Company has experienced and is continuing to experience a significant reduction in sales as a result of its inability to procure parts necessary to manufacture products due to the supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak. It remains unclear when or whether our supply chain partners will resume their activities at a level where our sales will return to historical levels.\n",
      "Line 1: Our business has been materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the Coronavirus or COVID-19. COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a &#8220;pandemic,&#8221; has spread to many countries, including the United States, and is impacting domestic and worldwide economic activity. Since being declared a &#8220;pandemic&#8221;, COVID-19 interfered with our ability to meet with certain customers during 2020 and continued into the first half of 2021. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected the supply chain for many types of products and materials, particularly those being manufactured in China and other countries where the outbreak has resulted in significant disruptions to ongoing business activities.  The corporate opportunity waiver was included in the company's bylaws. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022, we experienced a material disruption in our supply chain as it relates to the procurement of certain sole source and other multiple source components utilized in a material portion of several product lines. There are frequent developments regarding the COVID-19 outbreak that may impact our customers, employees and business partners. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate the duration or the scope of the impact COVID-19 could have on the Company&#8217;s business. The Company has experienced and is continuing to experience a significant reduction in sales as a result of its inability to procure parts necessary to manufacture products due to the supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak. It remains unclear when or whether our supply chain partners will resume their activities at a level where our sales will return to historical levels.\n",
