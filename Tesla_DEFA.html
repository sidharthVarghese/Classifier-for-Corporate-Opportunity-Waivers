Ratification of the 2018 Award
Analyzed potential alternatives to ratification, including not ratifying
Received and considered substantial input from institutional and retail
stockholders, making note of &#x201C;powerful and persuasive&#x201D; feedback from
stockholders
Concluded ratification would avoid prolonged uncertainty about Elon&#x2019;s
compensation and motivation to devote his time and energy to Tesla
Process and proxy designed to address the issues raised by the
Delaware court and disclose detailed information to allow stockholders to
make fully informed decisions
Determined costs associated with any new replacement package would
substantially exceed costs of ratification
Determined, based on all relevant considerations, redomestication in Texas and
ratification of the 2018 Award are both in the best interests of all stockholders</font></p></td></tr></table></div><DIV STYLE="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.65%; margin-right: 2.65%; page-break-after: always"><DIV STYLE="text-align: left; background-color: #000000; clear: both; height: 2pt; border-width: 0; margin: 30pt 0pt"></div></div><DIV STYLE="text-align: left"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><TD WIDTH="92.3%" VALIGN="TOP" STYLE="text-align: left; padding: 0in 5.4pt; width: 92.3%"><P STYLE="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: left"><img src="tm2413800d10_defa14aimg009.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC" style="height: 843px; width: 1500px"></p></td><TD WIDTH="7.7%" VALIGN="MIDDLE" STYLE="text-align: left; padding: 0in 5.4pt; width: 7.7%"><P STYLE="text-align: left; margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">PROPOSAL 3

Texas' Legal Regime Permits Tesla to Innovate and Pursue Its World-Changing Mission
11
Texas&#x2019; legal regime allows Tesla
to promote its strong mission
Express statutory provision that would allow
directors to consider the company&#x2019;s mission &#x2013; a
mission that is fundamental to Tesla&#x2019;s culture
and critical to recruitment, motivation and
retention from the factory floor to the boardroom
Tesla stockholders care about
advancing our mission
Tesla stockholders believe fundamentally in our
mission
The company received letters from thousands of
Tesla stockholders &#x2013; large and small &#x2013;
supporting a move home to Texas, recognizing
it&#x2019;s where we belong
Tesla&#x2019;s identity is intertwined with
its Texas headquarters
Many of the most successful companies in the
U.S. are incorporated in the state where they are
headquartered &#x2013; i.e., their home state (e.g.,
MSFT, AAPL)
There is value in business disputes being heard
where Tesla is headquartered &#x2013; the community

1. Since 2014, ISS has recommended FOR 100% of public-company redomestications to Texas (i.e., 7 out of 7, of which 5 were from Delaware to Texas). In 2022 (Alset) and 2019 (Legacy Housing), ISS wrote, &#x201C;reincorporation
from Delaware to Texas would appear to have a neutral impact on shareholders&#x2019; rights.&#x201D; Since 2014, Glass Lewis has recommended FOR 80% of public-company redomestications to Texas (i.e., 4 out of 5, of which 3 were from
Delaware to Texas). In 2019 (Legacy Housing), Glass Lewis wrote, &#x201C;in most respects, the corporate statues in Delaware and Texas are comparable.&#x201D; For the one redomestication from Delaware to Texas that Glass Lewis

Elon&#x2019;s only opportunity to receive any compensation at all for his work and leadership would come from delivering
transformative growth and extraordinary value to stockholders in 10 years' time. He did it in 5 years.

Performance Award 100% Aligned with Stockholder Interests

The 2018 Award was 100% performance-based and at risk The 2018 Award was aligned with
stockholders&#x2019; interests
Because Elon is required to hold shares
for five years after exercising options, he
remains incentivized to drive value for
stockholders
The 2018 Award was comprised of
options, not RSUs &#x2013; meaning Elon&#x2019;s
compensation was driven by him creating
value for stockholders
If Elon hits ambitious targets,
creating extraordinary value
for stockholders
If Elon fails to achieve the
ambitious growth targets
Elon receives stock
options commensurate
with that achievement

Mr. Musk&#x2019;s new targets are even more
ambitious than the 10-year goals from 2012
that he blew through years early. The
potential value of share grants totaling 12
percent of the company is vast, but at least
the Tesla board has done much more than
the usual lip service in setting a serious
challenge.&#x201D;
Antony Currie, Reuters Breakingviews
(January 23, 2018)
In the context of history, the financial targets
Tesla has set are lofty, if not extraordinary.
We note that CEO's Musk incentive targets
call for Tesla's revenue to grow at a 32%
compounded rate for the next 10 years, and
its market cap to grow at 28% per year over
the next 10 years &#x2013; there are only two
companies in history that have grown
revenue from ~$11B to $100B in less than
10 years (Apple and Amazon).&#x201D;
Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein
(February 7, 2018)
It&#x2019;s breathtaking both in size and in terms of
performance required to earn it&#x2026;Like
everything Musk is involved in, whether it&#x2019;s
building a company from scratch or
launching satellites into space, this is
beyond expectation.&#x201D;
Anders Melin, Brandon Kochkodin, Dana
Hull, Bloomberg (January 23, 2018)
Elon Musk will remain at Tesla under a 10-
year, all-or-nothing pay package that
demands massive growth. The
agreement&#x2026;requires that Tesla grow in $50
billion leaps, to a staggering $650 billion
market capitalization. Tesla must also hit a
series of escalating revenue and adjusted
profit targets, only after which Musk would
vest stock options worth 1 percent of
company shares.&#x201D;
Jamie Cook, CFA, Credit Suisse
(January 26, 2018)
 &#x2026;Targets That Most Thought Were Impossible for Tesla to Achieve
16
Mr. Musk&#x2019;s new compensation plan&#x2026; is perhaps the most radical
in corporate history: Mr. Musk will be paid only if he reaches a
series of jaw-dropping milestones based on the company&#x2019;s market
value and operations. Otherwise, he will be paid nothing&#x2026; As
executive compensation plans go, Tesla&#x2019;s is about as friendly to
shareholders as they come.&#x201D;
Andrew Ross Sorkin,
The New York Times (January 23, 2018)
Even compared with the bullish financial modelling that has
propelled Tesla to its current valuation, its new executive pay
targets outlined last week look pretty ambitious&#x2026; [O]nly three
companies had a market value of more than $650bn at the end of
2017: Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google&#x2019;s parent). GM&#x2019;s
market capitalisation is $61.5bn and Ford is worth $41bn.&#x201D;
Karl West, The Guardian (January 26, 2018)
The unusual package is based entirely on performance,
guaranteeing no salary and no bonus, and requires Musk to reach
aggressive market capitalization and financial goals in order to be
paid. He would also have to hold onto his shares for five years
after he receives them before selling, a rare stipulation that&#x2019;s
viewed as particularly shareholder-friendly&#x2026;Yet compensation
experts said the biggest message Musk&#x2019;s new pay plan may be
designed to send is not just that Tesla intends to take an
unusually performance-driven approach to paying its CEO. It&#x2019;s
that the company has galaxy-size ambitions for its growth and
aims to rival the planet&#x2019;s largest tech companies over the next
decade.&#x201D;

Ratification ensures stockholders&#x2019; voices are heard on this critical matter
As Tesla shareholders, we want our shareholder votes
to count (not be rescinded years later); we want Tesla
CEO Elon Musk to be compensated for his Past Work
(that is keep ALL stock options previously awarded for
meeting the 2018 Musk Incentive Comp Plan
milestones)&#x2026; [We] [w]ould like the Board to explore
options to affirm the shareholder vote in support of

active and in place.&#x201D;
Letter to Tesla's Board of Directors on
Behalf of 5,821 Stockholders
The requirements of the 2018 package
were extraordinarily ambitious &#x2014; and they were
delivered. It is not reasonable for investors to expect to
re-absorb the canceled options and consider all
that value creation to have been delivered to us for
no consideration. Therefore, if it is legally advisable,
we suggest simply subjecting the original 2018
package to a new shareholder vote, accompanied
by expansive disclosure as to the process
undertaken and the potential conflicts of interest that
were considered at the time.&#x201D;

Shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favour of
the CEO&#x2019;s compensation package in 2018. I
subsequently bought stock with full awareness and

Less costly option to compensate for past work and to incentivize Elon for the future
 &#x2026;While Ensuring We Compensate Our CEO As Promised
New Compensation
Award Would Be Costly
A functionally equivalent1 grant of
new options could result in an
accounting charge of more than
$25 billion, compared to the $2.3
billion granted in 2018
Per the Special Committee, Elon
Confirmed That the 2018 Award
Would Incentivize and Motivate
Him For the Future
Under Elon&#x2019;s leadership, Tesla is well-positioned to lead in large and rapidly
growing markets, with an evolving and
vast ecosystem of transformative
technologies
Ratification Compensates Elon
for Value Created
Elon told the Committee he wants to
be treated fairly and with respect. He
performed, against all odds, in
accordance with the terms of the
deal, delivering extraordinary value
for Tesla stockholders
A deal should be a deal: stockholders approved the plan.
Elon hit the targets. We should hold up our end of the deal.

Concern Raised&#x2026; &#x2026; What Actually Happened
Award locked in high-pay opportunities for years and
diminished Compensation Committee&#x2019;s ability to adjust
pay levels to reflect shifts in performance or strategy.
No adjustment of pay levels was necessary. Within five years &#x2013; half the time of
the 2018 award period &#x2013; Elon met all performance metrics and transformed
the company&#x2019;s financial profile.
Alternate operational goals provide for significant vesting
regardless of sustained profitability. Several tranches
could be earned based on either revenue or adjusted
EBITDA targets.
Other than two tranches, which were met based on revenue, every other
tranche was met based on hitting high EBITDA performance hurdles. Elon
successfully turned profit from a $2.2 billion loss to a $15.0 billion net income.1
Adjusted EBITDA targets excluded stock
compensation expense.
Elon delivered positive earnings beyond the amount returned as
compensation. Removing impact of all stock-based compensation expenses,
Tesla still hit each EBITDA target (unadjusted for stock-based
compensation) in short order.
Achieving targets would lead to high compensation level
for Elon without commensurate compounded revenue
growth and compounded share price growth (only slightly
outpacing S&amp;P 500).
Elon delivered all tranches in five years, which translates to an astonishing
compound share price growth of 45%2 and a compound revenue growth of
47%.3 The actual stock price growth delivered was more than 9 times the
S&amp;P 500 over the same period.4
Magnitude of the award was not discussed transparently
with investors.
The magnitude of the award was clearly outlined in the 2018 proxy statement,
including the value that would be realized upon achievement of the targets.
There is a lack of clear prohibitions against
repricing the grant. The options were not repriced and cannot be without stockholder approval.
