business has been materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the Coronavirus or COVID-19. COVID-19, which has been declared
by the World Health Organization to be a &#8220;pandemic,&#8221; has spread to many countries, including the United States, and is impacting
domestic and worldwide economic activity. Since being declared a &#8220;pandemic&#8221;, COVID-19 interfered with our ability to meet
with certain customers during 2020 and continued into the first half of 2021. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected the supply
chain for many types of products and materials, particularly those being manufactured in China and other countries where the outbreak
has resulted in significant disruptions to ongoing business activities. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing into the
first quarter of 2022, we experienced a material disruption in our supply chain as it relates to the procurement of certain sole source
and other multiple source components utilized in a material portion of several product lines. There are frequent developments regarding
the COVID-19 outbreak that may impact our customers, employees and business partners. As a result, it is not possible at this time to
estimate the duration or the scope of the impact COVID-19 could have on the Company&#8217;s business. The Company has experienced and
is continuing to experience a significant reduction in sales as a result of its inability to procure parts necessary to manufacture products
due to the supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak. It remains unclear when or whether our supply chain partners will resume
their activities at a level where our sales will return to historical levels.</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&#160;</span></p></ix:continuation></ix:continuation><div>

accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. During the year ended December
31, 2021, the Company reported reduced revenues, a loss from operations and net cash used in operating activities, in conjunction with
liquidity constraints. The above factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of the
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&#160;</span></p></ix:continuation></ix:continuation><div>
