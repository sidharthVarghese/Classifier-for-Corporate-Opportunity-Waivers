The disposition of the Colortronic Shares was made\\npursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 23, 1995 (the \"Share\\nPurchase Agreement\"), by and among K-Tron Germany, K-Tron Holding and\\nDolemeyer.

Rohr and Schuler resigned from all of their\\npositions with K-Tron in connection with the sale, such resignations having\\nbeen effective on June 30, 1995, and Leo C. Beebe, K-Tron\\'s chairman, has\\nassumed the duties of chief executive officer.\\n\\n                 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. acted as financial advisor to K-Tron\\nin the sale of Colortronic, which was the result of a comprehensive marketing\\neffort conducted by such firm.\\n\\n\\nITEM 5.          OTHER EVENTS.\\n\\n                 As previously reported, K-Tron is in default under several\\nfinancial covenants contained in its loan agreement with three U.S. banks.\\nThese defaults are continuing and have not been waived.
